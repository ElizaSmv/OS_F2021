Hit occur when the referenced page is already in the memory, and miss occur otherwise. Therefore Hit ratio = 1 - Miss ratio.

So, the more identical references in the sequence, and the larger the number of page frames would be,
the more hit ratio, and the lower miss ratio are.
And vice versa, the wider pull of references in the sequence, and the smaller the number of page frames would be,
the lower hit ratio, and the more miss ratio are.
